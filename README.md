# SupportRecovery
This repository contains the replication codes for 
"Economic Time Series Predictions and the Illusion of Support Recovery" by
[Adämmer and Schüssler (2024)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4019646). The code is mainly written in Julia but we also use R for some routines and visualizations.  We have also rewritten the Matlab code by [Giannone et al. (2021) ](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2021/09/01/economic-predictions-big-data-illusion-sparsity) in Julia.

# Codes
The Julia packages will be automatically installed when instantiating the environment. The procedure is explained in the README files. 
For R you have to install the following packages:  <br />
R packages |
:--------|
`BeSS`   |
`xtable` | 
`ggplot2` | 
`dplyr` |
`tidyr` |
`stringr`|
`scales` | 
`lemon` | 
`forcats` | 

## Case Studies 
'Readme_CaseStudies.txt' explains how to initialize the environment in Julia and how to use the codes to replicate the results of the paper. 

## Simulations
'Readme_Simulation.txt' explains how to initialize the environment in Julia and how to use the codes to replicate the results of the paper. 

## Figures
The folder "Figures" contains all empirical results and R codes to replicate the Figures of the paper.  
'Readme_Figures.txt' explains how to use the R codes.

# Data
All information and data sources can be found in 'Data_Sources.txt'. The data sets are contained in the folder "Data".  <br />
